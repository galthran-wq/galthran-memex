# Analytic Philosophy Study Plan

## Context

Self-directed curriculum for analytic philosophy. Background: classical philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Hume, Kant), mathematical training. Approach: survey-first, then selective deep dives into primary sources.

**Survey spine**: Soames, *Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century* (2 vols).

---

## Phase 0: Orientation (1-2 sessions)

**Goal**: What analytic philosophy *is*, how it differs from continental, the arc from Frege to present.

**Read**: Soames Vol. 1, Chapters 1-3 (or Glock, *What Is Analytic Philosophy?*)

**Memex output**: `analytic-philosophy-overview.md` — map of major movements.

**Status**: Not started

## Phase 1: Language & Logic

The founding thread. Closest to math — natural starting point.

### Primary texts (in order)
1. Frege, "On Sense and Reference" (1892, ~25pp)
2. Russell, "On Denoting" (1905, ~15pp)
3. Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1951, ~20pp)
4. Kripke, *Naming and Necessity* (1980, ~150pp) — **most important text on the list**

### Concepts to capture
- Sense vs. reference (Sinn/Bedeutung)
- Definite descriptions & Russell's theory
- Analytic/synthetic distinction
- Holism & web of belief
- Rigid designators & possible worlds semantics
- A priori vs. necessary (Kripke's separation)
- The linguistic turn

**Status**: Not started

## Phase 2: Epistemology & Philosophy of Science

What counts as knowledge? What makes science work?

### Primary texts
1. Gettier, "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" (1963, 3pp!)
2. Quine, "Epistemology Naturalized" (1969, ~20pp)
3. Kuhn, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* (1962, ~200pp)
4. Popper, *The Logic of Scientific Discovery* (selections)

### Optional
- Goodman, "The New Riddle of Induction" (grue/bleen)
- Goldman, "What is Justified Belief?" (reliabilism)
- Bayesian epistemology overview

### Concepts to capture
- JTB and the Gettier problem
- Reliabilism, tracking theories
- Falsificationism vs. verificationism
- Paradigm shifts & normal science
- Underdetermination of theory by evidence
- Problem of induction (Hume → Goodman)

**Status**: Not started

---

## Phase 3: Metaphysics

What exists? What's possible? What persists through change?

### Primary texts
1. Lewis, *On the Plurality of Worlds* (1986, selections)
2. Parfit, *Reasons and Persons* (1984, Part III: Personal Identity)
3. van Inwagen, *Material Beings* (1990, selections)

### Optional
- Chisholm on identity through time
- Lewis, "Causation" (counterfactual theory)
- Frankfurt, "Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility"

### Concepts to capture
- Possible worlds & modal realism
- Necessity, contingency, supervenience
- Personal identity: psychological vs. physical continuity
- Mereology & composition
- Counterfactual theories of causation
- Compatibilism vs. libertarianism (free will)

**Status**: Not started

---

## Phase 4: Ethics (Metaethics focus)

Not "what should I do?" but "what *is* morality?"

### Primary texts
1. Moore, *Principia Ethica* (1903, Ch. 1)
2. Mackie, *Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong* (1977, Ch. 1)
3. Parfit, *Reasons and Persons* (1984, Part IV: population ethics)

### Optional
- Rawls, *A Theory of Justice* (Ch. 1-3)
- Scanlon, *What We Owe to Each Other*
- Hare, *The Language of Morals*

### Concepts to capture
- Moral realism vs. anti-realism
- Naturalistic fallacy & open question argument
- Error theory, expressivism, prescriptivism
- Consequentialism, deontology, contractualism
- Population ethics & the repugnant conclusion

**Status**: Not started

## Memex conventions

- **Tags**: `philosophy` + area tag (`logic`, `language`, `epistemology`, `metaphysics`, `ethics`, `philosophy-of-science`)
- **Types**: `concept` for ideas, `reference` for texts, `insight` for cross-connections, `question` for open problems
- **Edges**: cross-reference liberally — Kripke's necessity connects Phase 1 to Phase 3, etc.

## Estimated scope

~15-25 study sessions total. Not a race.
