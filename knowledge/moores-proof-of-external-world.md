Moore responds to Kant's claim that it is "a scandal to philosophy" that the external world's existence must be taken on faith.

## The proof

P1. Here is one hand. *(holds up hand)*
P2. Here is another hand.
C. Therefore, at least two things external to our minds exist.

Three requirements for proof, all satisfied: (1) premises differ from conclusion, (2) conclusion follows logically, (3) premises are known to be true.

## Clarification: "external to our minds"

Moore carefully distinguishes *things to be met with in space* (tables, hands — can exist unperceived, publicly accessible) from *things presented in space* (pains, afterimages — logically private, exist only when perceived). "External to our minds" means: conceptually possible to exist without anyone perceiving it.

## The ironic purpose

The proof is not meant to convince the skeptic. Anyone who demands a proof has already accepted a restrictive epistemology that would reject Moore's premises. The point: **no such proof is needed**.

## Anti-skeptical strategy

Skeptical arguments have the form:

1. All knowledge is thus-and-so *(restrictive theory: evidence must logically entail conclusion)*
2. Knowledge of hands is not thus-and-so
3. Therefore, no one knows there are hands

But (1), (2), and "I know this is a hand" (4) are jointly inconsistent. Moore: (4) is more credible than (1), so reject the skeptic's theory of knowledge. The real philosophical problem is not *whether* we know, but constructing a theory of knowledge consistent with obvious instances like this.
