Two-volume survey of analytic philosophy covering 1900–1975. Grew out of Soames's lecture courses at Princeton. Aimed at upper-division undergraduates and beginning graduate students.

## Volume 1: The Dawn of Analysis

| Part | Subject | Chapters |
|------|---------|----------|
| I | G.E. Moore — ethics, epistemology, analysis | 1–4 |
| II | Bertrand Russell — logical and linguistic analysis | 5–8 |
| III | Wittgenstein's *Tractatus* | 9–11 |
| IV | Logical positivism, emotivism, ethics | 12–15 |
| V | Early Quine — analytic/synthetic, holism | 16–17 |

## Volume 2: The Age of Meaning

Covers later Wittgenstein, ordinary language philosophy, Grice, Davidson, Kripke's *Naming and Necessity*.

## Two central achievements of the tradition (per Soames)

1. **Grounding in common sense**: philosophical theories are tested against pre-philosophical convictions, not the other way around.
2. **Disentangling modal/epistemic concepts**: separating logical truth, necessary truth, a priori truth, and logical consequence — "the most significant philosophical advance of the twentieth century."

## Notable omission

The highly technical formal tradition (Frege → Tarski → Gödel → Carnap → modal model theory → Montague/Kaplan) is largely excluded. Soames treats the philosophical *consequences* of this work but not the machinery.
