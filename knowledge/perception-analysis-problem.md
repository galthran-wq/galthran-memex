Given that we know material objects exist (common sense) and that perception involves sense data, how does perception yield knowledge of mind-independent objects?

## Three failed analyses of "I see a table" ($A$)

**Direct Realism**: No sense data in normal perception; $A$ has no deeper analysis. We just see the table.
- *Problem*: Conflicts with the envelope argument (different observers see different patches of the same object). Also, hallucinations and normal perception feel identical from the inside — ad hoc to say only one involves sense data.

**Representationalism**: $A$ means $\exists! x\,(x \text{ is a table} \land x \mathrel{R} \text{my current sense datum})$ for some relation $R$ (causation, or "appearance-of").
- *Problem*: If we only ever directly perceive sense data, we're trapped behind a veil — no way to verify what bears $R$ to our sense data, or what those things are like.

**Phenomenalism**: $A$ means a long conjunction of actual and counterfactual sense-data statements ("if I walked left, I'd see...; if I reached out, I'd feel..."). Material objects = "permanent possibilities of sensation" (Mill).
- *Problem*: Circular. The counterfactuals reference material objects (walking requires legs, reaching requires hands). These would themselves need reduction to sense data, ad infinitum.

## Status

Moore found all three unsatisfactory. He left the problem open — an honest impasse that stimulated Russell, Wittgenstein, and the logical positivists.

## Note: Bayesian defense of representationalism

One can argue that the "veil" objection to representationalism is overstated. On a Bayesian reading, sense data update a posterior distribution over world-states. You never verify the decoder directly, but coherent prediction is sufficient justification — analogous to never knowing the true parameter of a distribution, only updating estimates. Hallucinations are handled as outliers inconsistent with priors. This is close to reliabilism (Goldman, 1970s).
