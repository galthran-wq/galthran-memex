Given Moore's defense of common sense — that our most basic pre-philosophical convictions cannot be overturned by philosophical argument — what remains for philosophy to do?

Moore's answer: **analysis**. We know these propositions; philosophy must analyze *what exactly we know* when we know them.

## Two applications

**Perception**: We know the external world exists. The analytic problem:
1. Knowledge comes through sense experience
2. Sense data are private mental events (observer-dependent)
3. Objects of knowledge are public (observer-independent)
4. Gap between private evidence and public knowledge

Philosophy must explain how this gap is bridged — not question *whether* it is.

**Ethics**: Moore seeks theories of the form $\forall x,\; x \text{ is good iff } x \text{ is } F$. But he argues goodness is a simple, unanalyzable property — apprehended by moral intuition, not decomposable into natural properties. Consequence: we cannot *prove* what is good by argument; we can only clear away confusions.

## Significance

This reframing defined the analytic tradition's self-image for decades: philosophy as clarification and analysis of concepts, not as construction of speculative systems.
