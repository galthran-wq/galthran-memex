Common sense propositions are propositions of maximal credibility — functioning like axioms. Moore enumerates them in "A Defense of Common Sense" (1925):

1. (a) I have a human body in a 3D world with distance and time; I was born and I grow.
   (b) Other human bodies exist, live, grow, and eventually die; we share the same world.
   (c) The earth existed before my birth; many bodies had already lived and died.
   (d) I have *experiences* of various types: perception of bodies and objects, spatial relations, memories, expectations, true and false beliefs, imagination, dreams.
   (e) Other humans have experiences of the same *types* (not necessarily the same contents).
2. Other people also know that the propositions in (1) are true.

## Self-refutation argument

If a philosophical argument yields $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n \vdash \neg A$ where $A$ is a common sense proposition, the correct response is not to reject $A$ but to conclude $\neg P_1 \lor \neg P_2 \lor \cdots \lor \neg P_n$ — rejecting the least credible premise. Skeptics and solipsists forget that $A$ is already known.

Moore observes that skeptical arguments are *performatively* self-refuting: a skeptic who publishes a book denying the external world presupposes readers, publishers, and a shared physical reality — i.e., presupposes $A$.

## Epistemic priority claim

Common sense propositions are more credible than any philosophical premise that contradicts them. No speculative principle can outweigh our confidence in these foundational convictions.
