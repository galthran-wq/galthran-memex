Sense data are mind-dependent entities posited as the direct objects of perception. They correspond to Moore's "things presented in space," in contrast to "things to be met with in space" (material objects, external to our minds).

## Definition via abnormal cases

In hallucination (a dagger on a blank wall), afterimages (a gold circle after staring at a bright light), and double images (two pencils when pressing your eye), you perceive *something* — but not a material object. These somethings are sense data.

## Properties

1. **Logically private** — cannot be perceived by more than one person. If two people hallucinate rats, they have different hallucinations; differing reports always imply different sense data.
2. **Exist only when perceived** — when the afterimage fades, the circle ceases to exist. Contrast: a table continues to exist unperceived.
3. **No appearance/reality gap** — sense data have exactly the properties they appear to have. If hallucinated rats seem pink, they *are* pink.
4. **Exist in private space** — your visual sense data are in your private visual field, not in public space.

## The envelope argument (extension to normal perception)

Moore holds up an envelope. Every student sees the same envelope, but each sees a different *patch* — different size, shape, color depending on their position. Since the patches have different properties, by Leibniz's law they are different objects. But all students see the same envelope. Therefore: the patches $\neq$ the envelope. Since it would be arbitrary to single out one student as directly perceiving the envelope, Moore concludes that *nobody* does — everyone perceives private sense data, even in normal perception.

## Tension with common sense

If all perception is of sense data, we never directly perceive material objects. But Moore insists (by common sense) that we *know* material objects exist. The central unsolved problem: how does private sense data yield knowledge of the public world?
